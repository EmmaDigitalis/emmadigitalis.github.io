So this is the part where I rant about "guys" things that have such a stigma that girls
have trouble doing them without feeling judged or out of place. I hate gender norms, and
things like girls not being allowed to play games, or girls needing to dress in a certain
way are such old-fashioned thoughts that I truly don't know why they still exist. Can
we just stop it with those things? They have no place on this planet anymore.
